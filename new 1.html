  <h2>About Me and my teaching philosophy</h2>
  <p>
 My name is Lina. I am a dedicated educator specializing in the integration of digital technology in teaching and learning. I firmly believe that education should encompass a curriculum that equips students with the skills necessary to meet the demands of the current job market. In my course on teaching and learning strategies, I delineate my pedagogical approach into two domains: 1. critical thinking and cognitive development, and 2. technology implementation and utilization. These domains are interrelated and offer complementary perspectives from both instructional and learner standpoints.

On one hand, I strive to impart to students an understanding of how learning operates and foster effective learning strategies. On the other hand, I guide them in developing the ability to teach these learning skills to others. This encompasses topics such as educational technology, educational psychology, and educational curriculum design. Given the unique context of the digital age and the prominence of artificial intelligence, I aim to empower my students with the confidence to utilize digital tools for teaching and learning, while embracing the transformative potential of technology.

Throughout the course, my students will acquire valuable skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic editing using applications such as DaVinci Resolve, enabling them to advance their learning and teaching visions with a broader perspective. I take great satisfaction in witnessing my students' ability to identify what to teach, how to teach it, and how to continually update their knowledge and learning experiences through the effective integration of digital technology. This empowers them for lifelong learning, while enabling them to create aesthetically pleasing and interactive websites that offer exceptional user experiences.
 for the life long learners.
